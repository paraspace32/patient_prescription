Application where the User’s data can be shared only if they approve it. 

There are 3 types of users/roles:
Patient/User
Doctor
Pharmacist

The Patient has medical records and prescriptions. If a doctor asks for a patient’s prescription, the patient has to approve it. Same goes with the Pharmacist, if the pharmacist wants to view the patient’s prescription, the patient has to approve it.
